## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Emeka, and I'm an atmospheric scientist interested in all things Python and Data Science! 

- ðŸš€ Iâ€™m currently working on Predicting air pollutant concentrations using artificial neural networks to improve air quality modeling and environmental forecasting.
- ðŸ”­ Developed a robust sentiment analysis system using state-of-the-art NLP models. Please, check it out!
- ðŸ”­ Completed a challenge on Healthcare cost prediction by machine learning.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™ve completed my task on predicting loan default using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) implemented in Python with TensorFlow and Keras.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m open to collaborating on data-driven projects at the intersection of business, finance, healthcare, and machine learning applications across the sciences, technology, and engineering domains.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:
        - Air quality modeling, pollution trend assessment, and climate data analytics,
        - Reproducible research workflows using Jupyter Notebooks, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn,
        - Building dashboards and ETL pipelines for large environmental datasets.
- Send me ideas to emekaugboma@gmail.com
