## Hi there 👋

My name is Emeka, and I'm an atmospheric scientist interested in all things Python and Data Science! 

- 👯 Our latest collaboration has led to a new peer-reviewed publication entitled “City-produced and transported black carbon: Synergy of in-situ optical measurements and modeling.”
     The article is open access and freely available to all readers. Here is the link to the paper: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2025.108731
- 🚀 I’m currently working on predicting air pollutant concentration via LSTM to improve air quality modeling.
- 🔭 Developed a robust sentiment analysis system using state-of-the-art NLP models. Please, check it out!
- 🔭 Completed a challenge on Healthcare cost prediction by machine learning.
- 🌱 I’ve completed my task on predicting loan default using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) implemented in Python with TensorFlow and Keras.
- 👯 I’m open to collaborating on data-driven projects at the intersection of business, finance, healthcare, and machine learning applications across the sciences, technology, and engineering domains.
- 💬 Ask me about:
        - Air quality modeling, pollution trend assessment, and climate data analytics,
        - Reproducible research workflows using Jupyter Notebooks, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn,
        - Building dashboards and ETL pipelines for large environmental datasets.
- Send me ideas to emekaugboma@gmail.com
