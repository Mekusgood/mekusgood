## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Emeka, and I'm an atmospheric scientist interested in all things Python and Data Science! 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™ve completed a task on healthcare cost prediction by machine learning.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™ve completed my work on advanced machine learning techniques for satellite data analysis and Python-based geospatial libraries like GeoPandas and PyTorch.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects related to air quality modeling, remote sensing data analysis, and machine learning applications in atmospheric sciences.
  - Send me ideas to emekaugboma@gmail.com
