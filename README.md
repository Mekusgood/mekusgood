## Hi there 👋

My name is Emeka, and I'm an atmospheric scientist interested in all things Python and Data Science! 

- 🔭 Recently, I developed a robust sentiment analysis system using state-of-the-art NLP models. Please, check it out!
- 🔭 I’ve completed a task on healthcare cost prediction by machine learning.
- 🌱 I’ve completed my work on predicting loan default using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) implemented in Python with TensorFlow and Keras.
- 👯 I’m open to collaborating on data-driven projects at the intersection of business, finance, healthcare, and machine learning applications across the sciences, technology, and engineering domains.
- 💬 Ask me about:
        - Air quality modeling, pollution trend assessment, and climate data analytics
        - Reproducible research workflows using Jupyter Notebooks, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn
        - Building dashboards and ETL pipelines for large environmental datasets
- Send me ideas to emekaugboma@gmail.com
